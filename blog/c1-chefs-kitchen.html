  <h1>Diving in with the Right Attitude</h1>
  <h2>Thoughts on the Restaurant vs Kitchen mentality</h2>
  <h4>April 10, 2015</h4>

        Shereef from Dev Bootcamp talked to us in a video today that was describing a bit about the different types of mentality coming in. On one hand, there is the consumer/Restaurant mindset, where you come in to DBC having paid and expecting to get in, do the work, and get out. The counter to this is his Kitchen mentality which speaks to the fact that every person coming into the DBC Kitchen with varying levels of experince. The core difference is that every person is coming in together, working together, and building off one another to create and become better as one.

        Using this Kitchen mindset, I am thoroughly more excited than ever to jump into Dev Bootcamp. I am in control of what I want to learn and I want to put in 110%. After learning about fixed vs growth mindsets, I am eager to have the opportunity to utilize the growth mindset and push myself to learn more and become better every day. After years of being part of a system so hidebound with its fixed mindset, it's refreshing hearing Shareef talk about every person in DBC coming in with a unique set of skills, all ready to learn.

        One of the main reasons why I found DBC so interesting was its interest with the mind, body, spirit, and most importantly, emotional intelligence. I had learned about emotional intelligence and read Daniel Goleman's book <en> Emotional Intelligence </en> in different courses during my time at university, but I never really had a course built around it. Seeing this, I am so excited to be a part of jumping into the fire with everyone at DBC. I want to work with everyone I possibly can, learn from others, and engage as much as possible with this community.

        Coming into the program, I knew this was going to be difficult. Without a doubt, I was told it would be the most challenging 9 weeks + remote time I'd have undergone. I'm excited for it. It's going to be one of my biggest challenges as I have never done any programming before. However, even though I have only  just started the remote prep, every day I'm learning something new, something exciting, something innovative. I'm pushing my mind and my education beyond what I thought was possible. I'm not just reading from a textbook and spitting it out on a scantron, but I'm actually seeing progress in my own self-growth.

        I'm definitely nervous coming into DBC, as I have never done programming before, but it's a nervous-excitement. I know some days I'm going to be challenged to the edge, but part of me is excited to have that happen. I want to be pushed. I want to be challenged. Most of all, I want to prove that I can overcome these challenges and grow. I'm really eager to learn more, and despite the difficulties and challenges that I've already begun facing, it's thrilling to be learning. I can't wait for the next week!
