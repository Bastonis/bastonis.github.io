    <p>
      Before asking a question, whether to a coach or an online forum community such as Stackoverflow, always take the time to think about your problem. What are the key aspects that are giving you a difficult time? From here, search online through sites such as stackoverflow or Google using those keywords. It's likely that your question has been asked by someone in the past, and instead of asking again, let's try to find the answer! Asking a question into Google isn't going to be helpful--but if you can manipulate Google through your usage of the keywords you thought about, you are more likely able to find an answer. A sample infographic that can help you get more out of Google can be found <a href="https://d3rgj9au57pk8c.cloudfront.net/uploaded/attachments/11080.gif?v=21fa9b">here</a>! If you find sample answers that came up that answer an aspect of your question but doesn't answer it completely, save it! It can still help.
    </p>
    <p>
      So you looked up on online and couldn't find an answer! That's okay! Now let's imagine that you're going to ask your question to stackoverflow. First thing's first, make an account because someone's going to be more willing to answer a question by James than user888. If you commit yourself to the site and the question, you'll more likely find a helpful person who'll answer. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Now let's get to your post. The key ingredients for a post are an executive summary, an intro paragraph, and a short code segment that can be reproduced. 
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>The Executive Summary</li>
        <ul>
          <li>An executive summary is KEY when you're asking for help because it's the very first thing someone will see. </li>
          <li>If your executive summary was "Need Math Help", it's so generic that I have no idea what's inside. </li>
          <li>Give your summary some more meat and specificity without getting too verbose! </li>
          <li>Key things to keep in mind are what programming language? What platform? What OS? Anything that helps the user understand your environment, the better they can help. </li>
        </ul>
      <li>The Introduction</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Now it's time to expand on your executive summary.Make this a CONCISE summary of what your problem is!</li>
          <li>Provide enough detail but not so much that you are writing a story. Someone should be able to extrapolate all relevant information succinctly. </li>
        </ul>
      <li>The Code</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Don't just copy and paste your entire code from your text editor. It can get really mess if you do this. </li>
          <li> Instead, provide isolated code that's able to be reproduced. Again, make this as concise as possible. This will help others who also stumble upon your same problem. </li>
        </ul>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Make your final proofreads and submit your post! Be sure to follow up on your post! Respond when people post answers and update the post if you find something that can help. And as always, try to give some ASK feedback that will help maintain a good environment for future questioners!
