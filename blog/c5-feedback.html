      Pairing is a key component of the learning experience at DBC. Coming in with the mindset that we're all learning together in the kitchen, it's really fun working with different people from across the United States. However, because it's a fairly new concept to me, it took awhile getting used to it. Before getting down to the challenge, I always check in with the other person and then designate driver and navigator roles. Checking in is always a fun experience, as it sets the stage for how the pairing will go. I try to go beyond the usual "How are you?" and try to get to know the person a little more, especially since I don't know everyone in the cohort.

      The term navigator and driver are simple in concept: one person will navigate the road, essentially giving the pathway to the next step and ensuring the syntax is correct; the other person is the driver, who will be typing into the console. However, the actual implementation of this can get a little difficult. Usually I try to split up the challenge into two different sections so that we can alternate at one point and give the other person a chance to drive. If we follow this course, there is a clear distinction on who is doing what. However, on occasion, it does get a little difficult because sometimes when we are stuck, people want to try out their own methods, which would then blur the line between who is navigating and who is driving. That happened to me during one of the pairing sessions, and afterwards I realized my mistake when she gave me feedback on it later. From then on, I try to enforce my navigator role even more and explain my idea to the driver. If it gets difficult from there, I ask the driver if it's okay if I give it a go. It's a unique situation that takes a lot more getting used to in order to balance, but it's been really fun so far.

      Pairing has really given me a great experience. I am able to bounce ideas off of the other person, and I definitely learn new methods of how to do something because everyone approaches challenges from different perspectives. I really enjoy going the extra step with my pair, especially if we go through the different challenges quickly. It's fun seeing how deep down the rabbit hole we can go and learn as much as possible. It's a very unique dynamic because I am learning while simultaneously implementing what I learn. I am constantly reminded of the Kitchen video that we watched in the beginning, and I love learning alongside other people. Sometimes just saying things out loud and getting someone to talk with me about it helps clear up different ideas and issues. The only caveat is that when we are both stuck, it can become difficult to know how to continue approaching the challenge. One way we solved this was to simply take a break and then continue later on with new ideas.

      After the pairing session is over, we give each other feedback based on three key points: Actionable, Specific, and Kind aka ASK. In theory, these ideas are not complicated: Actionable means that the person receiving the feedback can work on something to improve; Specific means that your feedback didn't simply say "Good Job!" but instead referenced a specific instance that you are talking about; Kind doesn't mean nice, but moreso honest in the sense that you speak your mind about how you felt. While the framework is easily understood, actually giving someone feedback can be difficult. Being specific and kind comes fairly easy to me, as I can usually reference points while coding that elicited some sort of emotional response. However, being actionable is difficult for me, as I want to give feedback the person can work on and improve, but I don't want to be giving out advice when it's not warranted. We were told that the person receiving the feedback should internalize the feedback and then work on improving it from there. It's a fine line between giving actionable feedback and giving straight advice, and something that I want to work on more. When something elicits a negative emotion from me, I find it difficult expressing that displeasure in a way that a person can find actionable. I am looking at the ratings on my own feedback and definitely know I can improve on being more actionable in feedback. On helping me improve, I wish that when people rate my feedback, they could also give comments on how to improve, as giving percentages can get difficult to interpret.

      Receiving feedback, on the other hand, is very exciting for me. I really enjoy seeing how other people thought about the pairing experience, and it definitely helps seeing the session from a different pair of eyes. From the feedback I received, I definitely know that maintaining the driver/navigator roles is crucial to better pairing sessions, as the line gets murky at times the deeper into the challenge we go. In addition, I am still working on breaking up large problems and breaking it down into smaller ones that are more easily digestible. It's fun for me learning what I can improve on.

      Overall, I find pairing a very fun activity. It makes me a bit nervous coming in, but as I talk to my pair, I have always found it easy to talk to them and that eases up on the tension. However, It's a great learning experience and it's definitely helping me learn a lot!
