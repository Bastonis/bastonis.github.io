      Throughout my 22 years, race has always been a prevalent issue, whether in the news or experiences from my personal life. However, something that I didn't know of before was Stereotype Threat, when a person is viewed through the lens of a negative stereotype. Essentially, negative stereotypes affect the person's psyche and their wellbeing. When viewed through this lens, people are more likely to underperform, perform in self-handicapping habits, and even limit the person's willingness to pursue their dreams. Any individual can come under this stereotype threat--some examples include females in math and students from low socioeconomic backgrounds.

      It's curious that stereotype threat does not come up in school as often as say, Affirmative Action when talking about race. Studies in this category have been going on since 1965, yet throughout my highschool(2006-2010) and college career(2010-2014), this threat hasn't been taught or exposed to me.

      Being Asian-American, I began looking into this new concept for me and found this wonderful article written by Jennifer Lee in 2012 called <a href="http://thesocietypages.org/papers/asian-american-exceptionalism-and-stereotype-promise/">Asian American Exceptionalism and “Stereotype Promise”</a>. One idea that Lee touches on is the duality of this stereotype lens--there exists both a stereotype threat as well as a stereotype promise. This stereotype promise details how a positive stereotype pushes a person to fulfill that stereotype. In one study, Asian American females with a strong preference for math performed better when their ethnic identity was called upon and those same females did worse when their gender identity was called upon.

      I found that the stereotype that Asians must be bright, hard-working, and good at math affected me in the grand schema of education. While I cherish my education and everything that I learned, one thing that negatively impacted my life by being both Asian and male is that statistics are skewed against me for acceptance into university. Coming from California, where a huge population of Asians live, the application pool for Asians is huge volume-wise. With so many Asian students striving to get the top grades in their university, the pool categorically has a high GPA, high SATs, and an extensive list of extra-curriculars. It became known in my school that you weren't competing against the standard averages that colleges post online--you have to find the one that's specific towards Asians. This especially became prevalent at USC when I had friends trying to go to medical school. Looking at the statistics online, Asians needed to have a higher GPA and a higher MCAT score than what their average lists. It's definitely daunting that you have to be not just good, you have to be "Asian good" which has the same duality that Lee talks about. There's the pressure to strive for better grades/standardized test scores/etc, but at the same time, this has hurt our own chances of getting a better education.

      This is definitely not something that can be fixed easily. Racial stereotypes have been in existence for generations and generations. However, coming out of university, I clutch onto the fact that DBC believes in the growth mindset of learning. Although stats will always come into play in our current generation of education, I believe that the future can be different. I love the ideology of the growth  mindset, and learning to learn with a passion--not learning for a test. Since coming to DBC, I have enjoyed learning so much about how to think and how to challenge myself. It's not easy, but I'm loving every second of it.
