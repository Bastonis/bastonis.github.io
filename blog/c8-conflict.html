      In the sophomore year of USC, I was rooming with a friend but was sharing the suite with two people that I didn't know. My friend Raymond and I were always on the same page, and I talked to him about pretty much anything that year. However, our suitemate Brian ended up being a really difficult person to live with.
    </p>
    <p>
      A lot of tension with Brian came out from the kitchen use. I had bought some simple pots, pans, and tableware that I said people could use as long as they washed it every night so that other people could use it the next day. I would always wash my utensils and pots after using them, but it became a problem when Brian would cook kimchi and other seasoned meat on my pans and ended up leaving them in the sink. After the first night, I thought to myself that everyone is busy and he may not have time to do it, so I didn't say anything. On the second day, it was still dirty and disgusting, and I told him that I would appreciate it if he cleaned up after using the utensils I had bought. He said he would do it, but this cycle would go on for five days until I had enough and I just washed them myself. On top of that, he consistently created a giant pile of trash that would overflow the trashcan. I made most of the trash runs, and it was making me really upset because I ended up having to take care of his mess. 
    </p>
    <p>
      There were times when he cleaned it for a day, but then would justify that cleaning session with another five days of a dirty kitchen. This would continue to happen for a few weeks, until I came home exhausted one day from taking multiple exams and there was a pile of dishes stacked high and there were even flies. That really made me angry, and I confronted Brian about why he didn't respect any of my belongings. He continuously said that he did his share of the washing and cleaning, which is true if you count that one time of cleaning per five days, but time and time again, I showed that he hadn't done anything to improve the situation as I had asked for them to be done every night so that I could use it. I told him that he was being selfish for using up my pots, pans, and dishes and leaving them dirty because then I could no longer use my own utensils. I felt exasperated that everything I tried, from talking to him, to talking to his roommate, to even asking for the Residential Advisor's help, didn't change anything. He was set in his ways, and anything I said wouldn't change it. I felt like I had no options left in trying to reason with him. 
    </p>
    <p>
      To combat this, I bought a new set of dishware: 1 pot, 1 set of utensils, and 1 plate. I kept them in my room and separate from Brian because I didn't want to deal with him. Looking back, this was definitely an avoidance strategy, and I even went so far as to split a mini-fridge with my roommate so that we could have some of our food separate from his, as he consistently left raw meat and open kimchi jars around the fridge. Raymond and I did our thing, and pretty much left Brian to his own. We didn't talk with him, and we didn't engage him in any way. We did our own thing and were happy to leave when the school year was over. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking back, I definitely practiced some attacking (confronting) and avoidance strategies that were outlined in the engineering empathy videos that we watched earlier. This was one of the most difficult academic years for me, and having to deal with a messy roommate situation made that year even more challenging to deal with. Using these attacking and avoidance strategies didn't really solve the problem, though. It was just a time-gated experience that would end when we left. However, I know that it'll never be like this ever again. Conflicts are definitely going to come up, and it won't be so easy to just ignore it until someone leaves.  
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm not sure how exactly I would change what I had done in this situation, as looking back on it, I had been empathetic initially, went on the offensive, and then went on the defensive. No matter what I did, I felt that there was no change. Perhaps in the future if this were to come up again, the entire group should set up rules that everyone should adhere to. I didn't enjoy that whole experience and it definitely made me adverse to living with random people, but it's a necessity that comes with housing, as I don't have the means to live by myself yet. After this, it's been easy for me as I've been lucky to room with people who share the same cleaning philosophy that I do, but if it came down to it again, the only thing I can really do is talk with that person and try to reason with them. Don't go on the attacking and just try to empathize and compromise as much as possible.
