      My Values: Achievement, Challenge, Compassion, Commitment, Cooperation, Health, Helping others, Integrity, Meaningful Work, Persistence, Reputation, Wealth, Will-power, and Loyalty.
    </p>
    <p>
      In general, I try to live up to these values with 1 being Diagree, and 5 being Agree:
      <ul>
        <li>Achievement:4</li>
        <li>Challenge:4</li>
        <li>Compassion:5</li>
        <li>Commitment:4</li>
        <li>Cooperation:4</li>
        <li>Health:4</li>
        <li>Helping Others:4</li>
        <li>Integrity:4</li>
        <li>Meaningful Work:3</li>
        <li>Persistence:4</li>
        <li>Reputation:5</li>
        <li>Wealth:4</li>
        <li>Will-Power:5</li>
        <li>Loyalty:5</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      The values that I chose mean the most to me, which is why I agree with those the most when I am living up to these values. One of these values that means a lot to me is: Commitment. I truly believe that if you commit to something, you must follow through with it. All you have in this world is your reputaiton and what you can make out of yourself. If no one takes you seriously and can believe in your word, it will be difficult for you to progress. Although difficult in many cases, I am always doing my best to honor my word and ensure that I follow through with what I say.

      The last time someone asked for my advice, he was in a relationship problem because there were so many moving pieces, one of which included me. Without going into specifics of his problem, I told him that Loyalty to your friends and family is important, and that it's not something that I would cast away so easily. People who are my friends I have had for many many years because I believe that loyalty, no matter the circumstances, means more than just hanging out with them. In times of need, being there and helping them is crucial and most of all, wanting what is best for them.

      After learning about stereotype threat and promise last week, it's difficult for me to say if any of my values will help me mediate stereotype threat because the one that hit me the hardest was something that dealt with the overall pool of Asians. I would say that being true to your values, no matter the stereotype, is important for yourself. Don't corrupt yourself and sacrifice what you value for something easy or to please others because what you choose to believe in and compose yourself with influences how you perceive the world and how the world perceives you.
