      One of the most interesting things I've been learning outside of the core coding experience with Dev Bootcamp has been trying to incorporate a lot of what we learn from the first week of Phase 0, which includes habit building, time boxing, and basically how to improve yourself as a human. However, before any of that started, I have always been interested in the human personality and have been fascinated with ideologies like MBTI. When DBC asked us to learn our VARK style and our Gregorian Thinking style, I was really curious and interested in how I learn and think. 
    </p>
    <p>
      VARK style learning talks about what mode do we go to that helps us learn. V is for Visual; A is for Auditory; R is for Reading/wRiting; K is for Kinesthetics. For the VARK style learning assessment, I found that I am very predominantly Visual and Kinesthetic--I enjoy seeing things, watching demonstrations, and most of all, touching with objects. Without a doubt, when I saw this, I identified myself with these two wholeheartedly. However, when I looked into the Gregorian Thinking style, I became a little bit more unsure, simply because I had no preconceived notion, as I already had with my tendency towards VK out of VARK.  
    </p>
    <p>
      The Gregorian Thinking style breaks up thinking styles into Concrete vs Abstract and Sequential vs Random, leaving us four different styles: Concrete Sequential, Concrete Random, Abstract Sequential, and Abstract Random. Being Concrete means that one takes in information through the senses and being in the present. Abstract means to visualize, conceive ideas, and understand what cannot be seen. Sequential is linear thinking, and Random is organizing information in chunks. The first time I took the Gregorian Thinking style assessment, I came up as heavily Abstract Random, but when I took it again today, I found that my AR had stayed the same, but my Concrete Sequential had shot up. I believe that even though they are on opposite sides of the spectrum, I do utilize both aspects. 
    </p>
    <p>
      AR thinkers organize through reflection, enjoy cooperative work, balancing social with work, and personalized learning. I found that I fall into this many times while learning. When peer-pairing I enjoy working together, trying to find solutions together, and reflecting back on what I did to achieve those results. I really do like learning about the other person, talking a little bit more about my peer's day and their situation in the personalized environment. On the other hand, when I am doing the solo challenges, it has shown my CS because I like order and quietness, exact directions, and applying ideas in real life. When we were learning about HTML/CSS I was constantly thinking about how I could use that information to build my website and make it better. 
      </p>
    <p>
      During DBC, I have really seen both sides come out because I believe I have been able to pinpoint when I like the different styles to show up. When I am learning new material, my CS side really shows through when I want to have order in learning material, especially when learning new material in DBC. Sometimes when the directions are unclear, I have gotten frustrated because I didn't know where to go or how to adjust myself so that I can learn more easily. I often times felt lost and wanted to learn what's the next step to get to the right direction. However, when I am doing the GPS or Peer pairing challenges, I have almost "turned on" the AR and have been able to talk with my friend and learn together while talking aloud as to why I wanted to do a certain task or event. Usually once I have a good grasp on the material where I learn as a CS person, I found that it's more easy for me to switch to AR and be in a group setting. Going forward, I'll need to be able to learn together in group settings and work on my own--the opposite of what I'm doing now. 
      </p>
    <p>
      I believe that I take both elements of AR and CS and use them in different times. The challenge will be how to actively make sure that I can either switch easily between the two as the situation arises, or be more conscious of how I am feeling and how I want to proceed. 
      </p>
    <p>
      As for the fixed mindset vs the growth mindset, I found that even though I have been trained in an education system built upon the fixed mindset, I am really liking the ability to finally be in an environment that encourages growth mindset. Even though I could do the fixed mindset method, I didn't enjoy it. When DBC talked about the growth mindset and actually using it, I was so happy to try and learn this way. To actively pursue my own learning career and to always be on the hunt for more information and new, innovative ideas. It's something that I really want to embrace. However, coming from 20 years of a fixed mindset background, I know I understand the transition to growth mindset doesn't happen overnight. It will take some time until I am fully immersed in the growth mindset experience, but I can't wait.
