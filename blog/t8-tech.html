      Growing up with computers, I've known bits and pieces of how a computer operates, but I haven't had a real chance to figure out how it all comes together. I wanted to take this chance to find out a little bit more about how it works, and eventually, I want to be able to create my own computer.
    </p>
    <p>
      A computer is essentially a machine that takes input and creates some sort of output. The computer is made up of 8 physical core components: the Case, the Motherboard, the Power Supply, the CPU, the RAM, drive(s), cooling systems, and cables. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Case varies depending on whether you have a laptop or a desktop. For a laptop, the case is made up of the lower-half which holds core components and an upper-half which makes up the screen. On the lower half's surface is a keyboard that you can type in. For a desktop, the case is only what holds the other core components. Desktop cases vary in size, but the main factor in choosing a case is for the type of motherboard that will be inside. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Motherboard is the primary circuitboard that affects the limitations of what the computer can do and how customizable the computer becomes using that motherboard. The main job of the motherboard is to hold the microprocessor chip and have connections for everything else. Different motherboards will have different layouts and have distinct placements for where other core parts will go. To name some of the parts: The microprocessor socket determines what central processing unit(CPU) will fit, the Basic Input Output System (BIOS) chip controls basic functions, and the chipset is a logic system that connects the CPU to the other parts. Additionally, the motherboard contains ports for video cards, sound cards, network cards, interfaces for hardrives, memory slots, and other extra peripherals. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Power Supply will connect the computer to a power source-- on a laptop, that could be a battery; on a desktop, a power outlet.  
    </p>
    <p>
      The CPU is the processor, which is the heart of operations. Performance of your computer relies on the type of CPU you have and its capabilities. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Random-Access Memory (RAM) is the main memory that can be accessed. Data can be read and written in the same amount of time. It is the available memory that is capable of running programs. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Drives are devices that hold data while not being in use. Typical drives are hard drives and solid-state drives which generally store the operating system as well as other programs that you place inside of the computer. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Cooling systems are required by computers because processing generates heat, and the machine needs to be within a certain temperature in order to function well. A cooling system will maintain the correct temperature and can range from fans to water-coolant systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cables are special for the computer that carry data, power, or both throughout the computer. 
    </p>
    <p> 
      External ports available to the computer all attach to the motherboard. Ports are essentially a communication channel from your computer to an external device. Some of these ports include USB ports, which many mice use, network ports such as for Ethernet, video ports for HDMI use, and an audio-jack port for your headphones. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Peripherals are the hardware not inside of the case. For a desktop, this will include the monitor, the mouse, the headphones, the microphones, the webcames, etc. In many laptops, many of these peripherals are integrated within the case. 
    </p>
    <p>
      All of these core components are managed by the Operating System--the major ones include Windows, Mac OSX, and Linux. These operating systems manage the memory usage, device management, available storage, and the user interface, to name some of its functions. 
    </p>
    <p>
      While this is simplistic in idea, this is a general overview of the hardware that's required to build a computer. I know that in the future when I want to build a machine, I'll definitely be looking at this more in-depth but it's always good to know the fundamentals.
