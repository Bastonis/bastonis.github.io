      The internet has allowed the expansion of the world, allowing the landscape to forever be changed. Through the internet, we are able to make connections across the world, purchase items from different countries, and so much more. The openness of the internet allowed for startups to grow into huge businesses. Services such as Google, Netflix, and Amazon not only disrupted the landscape of business in their fields but became big players in the industry as well. Every day, people around the world are trying to change and disrupt the way normal operations are being done with apps and other web services. Technology has revolutionized the way we interact with the world. That fostering of entrepreneurship and ideas comes from having an open internet.

      Having multiple business operate on the internet gives a lot of power to the Internet Service Providers, who control how people get onto the Internet. With so much power over so many people's access to the internet, these ISPs such as Verizon and AT&T began throttling people for their usage on the internet and proposed new fast-line and price prioritizations. This would make a tiered model for who can get onto the internet and at what cost. This severely limits the innovation and possibilities of the internet. Not only does it put all the power on broadband providers, but it takes away a lot of the bargaining power that smaller companies have in attracting new people. Those who cannot afford would have been unable to enter the market, whereas in an open system, everyone has the ability to post, create, and pretty much do anything online. On February 26, 2016, the Federal Communications Commission approved the proposal that reclassifies broadband as a utility under Title II of the Communications Act. Essentially, the new rules operate under three major premises: that America's networks be open, fast, and fair.

      However, even though the FCC passed Title II, the fight isn't over. Although ISPs are limited from having fast-lanes and payment prioritizations, carriers, ISPs, and even Congress seemingly don't want the internet to remain neutral. Those who can profit and gain at the expense of others will always remain. On April 30, 2015, Congress called a hearing called, "FCC Reauthorization:Improving Commission Transparency" which was done in order to add more requirements to the decision process, which could hinder the way that decisions are made in favor towards those who do not want the net to remain neutral. Whenever there is a step towards progress, there will always be people who want to push you back. That will always be the case, but something we must never give up in the face of this adversity.

      It seems incredulous to me that this issue even came up considering the large strides that tech has provided for the world. Everything uses the internet right now, and without it, we would surely be crippled. Tech and the internet has created opportunities that have changed the world. How is it that innovation must come at a price of how you can access the internet? TIn a world where big corporations want to squeeze every dollar out of us and try to own the way we interact with the world, it's inevitable that this conversation had to come up. I hope that people can realize that where we are today originated from having an open internet that has allowed us to make the great strides that we have made. 
    </p>
    <p>
      In the future, we must act and have our voices be heard. Our current generation has been the one that has changed the landscape for the better. We are part of the generation that has evolved with the internet and tech, to see the growth of multiple businesses that want to improve the world. Write in petitions, write to our legislation, because even though we may feel small--that one person couldn't change the outcome, we can't allow oppressive ISPs and other business conglomerates to dictate how we operate and use the internet. We wouldn't be here without having an open forum and net to build society upon. We have lived in a generation that has seen the benefits for entrepreneurship and opportunities. Don't let that be lost to our future generations.
